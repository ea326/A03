GIT: First developed back in 2005, Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile projects. (https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/)
GITHUB: GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service. (https://blog.devmountain.com/git-vs-github-whats-the-difference/)
Repository: Generically refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained. A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network.
